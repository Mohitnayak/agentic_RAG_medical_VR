# Dental Planning Basics â€” Context

- **Title**: Dental Planning Basics

## Purpose
Provide concise educational context to support answers about dental implant planning in the VR scene.

## Core concepts
- Anatomy landmarks: alveolar ridge, maxillary sinus, mandibular canal (inferior alveolar nerve), buccal/lingual cortical plates.
- General steps:
  1. Review imaging (CBCT/X-ray) to assess bone height/width and proximity to sinus/nerve.
  2. Select implant size (height/length) appropriate for site, respecting safety margins.
  3. Plan virtual placement with alignment to prosthetic outcome; avoid violating nerve and sinus.
  4. Consider grafting/sinus lift when bone is insufficient.
  5. Validate plan with guides; proceed to surgical phase.
- Safety margins: maintain distance from nerve and sinus as per guidelines/protocols.
- Visualization: enable nerve/sinus overlays when planning near critical structures.

## Notes
- Educational guidance only; not a substitute for clinical judgment.
- Always verify specific measurements and protocols before surgery.
